# Insecure Chat Server

This is the server side of the Insecure Chat project that is mandatory for the Security in Computing course at the VUB.
The course was taken during 2023-2024.

## How to use

```bash
$ cd insecure-chat-server
$ npm install
$ npm start

> insecure-chat-client@1.0.0 start
> electron .

```

The server is now available at `ws://localhost:3000`. Optionally, specify a port by supplying the `PORT` env variable.
You can connect to it by using the Insecure Chat Client.
